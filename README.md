### 👋 Hi there! I'm Akshita, an incoming third year computer science student at McMaster University. 
🔭 I’m deeply interested in Data Science and Machine Learning and I love working on end to end projects!

✅ I recently completed a research assistant internship under Dr. Alavi at McMaster University where I worked with Raspberry Pi and vibration sensors

🌱 I’m currently completing a PyTorch course and developing my machine learning skills by reading the book "Mathematics for Machine Learning" by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong.  

✨ Apart from working on end to end projects I enjoy volunteering and I am currently the Attendee Relations Executive at DeltaHacks, a club that hosts hackathons at McMaster! I've also volunteered as a social media coordinator for cancercare4kids, a club that spreads awareness about pediatric cancer.

📫 I love to meet new people so please dont hesitate to reach out to me on my email: baksha13@mcmaster.ca!
